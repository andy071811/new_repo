                    <h4>Salteñas</h4>

                    <p>Let’s start this list with one of the Bolivian foods that is considered the national dish of Bolivia.
                        Salteñas are savory stuffed empanadas. If you’ve never had an empanada, they are a pastry pocket containing a yummy filling.
                        In Bolivia that filling is typically either beef, pork, or chicken.
                        Salteñas are juicy on the inside, like a stew, with ingredients like olives, raisins, and potatoes.

                <div class="chicharron">

                    <h4>Chicharrón</h4>

                    <p>You’ll find Chicharrón in many Latin American countries, and each has its own take on how to prepare it.
                        In Bolivia, Chicharrón is made with cubes of pork containing meat from the pork shoulder, and lots of fat.
                        The pork is prepared with oregano, cumin, garlic, pepper, and salt. It is first cooked in water and then fried in high heat.
                        Lemon or beer may be added to complete the cooking process, to give the Chicharrón its crispy exterior.
                        Served with potatoes and mote (an Andean corn with giant kernels).

                <div class="pique macho">

                    <h4>Pique Macho</h4>

                    <p>Created in 1974 in Cochabamba, this dish is now popular throughout the country.
                        As the Macho in the name suggests, this is a huge dish meant to be shared. Or, if you’re super hungry you can try finishing it by yourself.
                        This heaping plate includes french-fried potatoes, sautéed beef, hot peppers, sausages, and condiments.
                        A smaller (and often less spicy) version of this dish is simply called Pique.

                <h3>Things to do</h3>

                <h4>Bike down the world’s most dangerous road</h4>

                <p>One of the most popular tourist attractions in Bolivia is the famous “Camino de la Muerte” – also known as the Death Road or World’s Most Dangerous Road.
                    The best way to experience this crazy ride is to hurtle down it on a mountain bike!
                    There are many tour operators that offer mountain biking down the Death Road, including Gravity.
                    If you’re an adrenaline-junky, this activity absolutely must be on your list.
                </p>

                <h4>Stand in awe of the world’s largest salt flat</h4>

                <p>Arguably the most famous place in Bolivia, the Salar de Uyuni is truly a spectacular and beautiful sight.
                    Hop on a tour and experience the salt flat for yourself, as well as the surrounding lagunas and deserts.
                    Be sure to take your camera along to snap some amazing reflection and perspective shots; you’ll also get the chance to admire the stunning landscapes and flamingoes of Laguna Colorada.
                </p>

                <h4>Float downriver in the Amazon Jungle</h4>

                <p>While many think of Brazil when they are considering visiting the Amazon rainforest, eastern Bolivia is also part of the Amazon Basin.
                    The jumping off point for most people wanting to explore this area is Rurrenabaque.
                    Hop on a tour that will take you on a boat trip down the river to Madidi National Park where you can come face-to-face with wildlife such as pink dolphins, parrots, and even anacondas!
