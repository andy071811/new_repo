            <h3>Food</h3>

            <p>Buenos Aires is known for its intensity—and that translates into its food.
                Here you can order the juiciest steaks, the most highly caffeinated tea, a cornucopia of a salad, and even “super” dulce de leche (God help us).
                Whether you have a sweet tooth or are an ardent carnivore, the city's diverse food scene will please all palates.
            </p>

            <h4>Empanadas</h4>

            <p>The most famous Argentine snack, appetizer, or meal (depending on how many you’re eating), empanadas are plump bread packets full of meat, vegetables, or cheese.
                Highly addictive, they wash down perfectly with an ice-cold beer. Popular flavors include beef, chicken, cheese and onion, humita (corn), or chorizo (pork).
                Empanadas are super versatile, and as the Buenos Aires gastronomy scene becomes more and more culinarily adventurous, new flavors have surfaced like Banco Rojo’s aloo gobi or vegan coconut curry ones.
                However, for old school flavors and a del barrio (neighborhood) ambiance, check out El Gauchito.
            </p>

            <h4>Bife de Chorizo</h4>

            <p>Argentina is known for beef and its strong asado (barbecue) culture. Bife de Chorizo is the king of meat cuts in Buenos Aires.
                Better known as “sirloin steak” in English, it arrives massive and juicy on your plate at parillas (the word for both grill and restaurant), with some fat around the edges for a little extra flavor.
                Order it from the godfather of parillas Don Julio, or try it at the young upstart of the parilla family, La Carniceria.
            </p>

            <h4>Mate</h4>

            <p>The great equalizer, everyone in Buenos Aires drinks mate.
                Loving mate is somehow woven into the DNA of Argentines, and the caffeine high it gives its drinkers is the reason why Buenos Aires is known for late-night nightlife.
                A loose-leaf tea, mate is generally drunk from a gourd through a metal straw with a filter on one end. People drink it on their own, but most times, it will be passed around in a group.
                If you don’t know Argentines you can share with, you can buy the gourd, straw, and tea at any supermarket in town.
                For a smoky, bold-flavored one, drink Cruz de Malta.
            </p>

            <h4>Dulce de Leche</h4>

            <p>Ubiquitous in Argentine desserts, dulce de leche is that gooey caramel-colored jam that tastes like mellow toffee, which overpowers your tastes buds in an avalanche of sugar.
                Made from slowly heating sweetened milk, dulce de leche can be eaten solo with only a spoon, or made into ice cream, hard candy, baked inside churros, found at the center of alfajores, used as a glue to hold cake layers together—really it’s everywhere and can be used in almost any kind of dessert.
                For a time-honored brand, buy San Ignacio Dulce de Leche in supermarkets throughout the city.

            <h3>Things to do</h3>

            <h4>El Caminito La Boca</h4>

            <p>Enjoy the colorful houses in Caminito (little walkway in English) and see how local painters bring their area to life on a white canvas.
                Caminito is located in the neighborhood “La Boca”. La Boca was in the mid-19th century the home of Spanish and Italian immigrants.
                The colorful houses came from the leftovers of paintings that they could get.
                Some say that the Tango was first danced here between two men. You will see some Tango shows while having lunch in one of the bars.
                You can visit the houses for free in La Boca. Enter the galleries where you see all the shops and take the stairs up.
                This is how you can see how life before was and where they lived.
                And, are you a Boca Juniors fan? Then, don’t miss the tour in the La Bombonera stadium and visit the La Boca Museum.
                You can book your tickets in advance.
            </p>

            <h4>Cementerio de la Recoleta</h4>

            <p>The cemetery of Recoleta is called one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the world.
                With the graves of Evita Perón (Eva Maria Duarte Perón), Noble prize winners and the daughter of Napoleon.
                The cemetery was created in 1822 next to the church Iglesia de Nuestra Señora del Pilar. It contains 4691 graves all located in a 5,5 ha area.
                The beautiful mausoleum gives the cemetery that special look. Explore the history of deceased loved ones.
                Because the history of the cemetery is so rich in info, I suggest taking a guided tour.
                Most of the tourists walk directly to the mausoleum of Evita and are missing a lot of info about the cemetery of Recoleta.
                A tour cost only USD 10 / €9. Worth the money.
                <br>
                Entrance fee for non-residents: USD 11
            </p>

            <h4>Puerto Madero</h4>

            <p>This is the area where the first European immigrants set foot in Argentina.
                During the 19th century, Puerto Madero was booming because of imports and export.
                After the 2nd world war, trade decreased tremendously and the hangars and cranes went into decay.
                Until a new government set a new goal for Puerto Madero.
                Lofts, hotels, museums, and luxury apartments are giving Puerto Madero the look of today with Puente de la Mujer bridge as the eyecatcher.
                Go with a sunset to Puerto Madero and enjoy a lovely walk while you see the sun going down. A perfect view.
